# DunderBot 🤖 – The Office RAG Application

![alt text](frontend/images/a299unbywmgz.jpg)

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end application leveraging LLM-based RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques to create a chatbot that interacts with The Office dataset. Users can search for episodes, retrieve quotes, and ask contextual questions about the show.

This project involves:
1.	Retrieval Pipeline: Implement a pipeline to retrieve dialogs and metadata from a vector database based on user queries.
2.	Interactive Web Application:
*	Users can input a phrase or mood to retrieve relevant quotes from The Office.
*	Users can search for episodes or ask metadata-based questions (e.g., “Who directed the episode where Dwight started a fire?”).
3.	LLM Comparison: Incorporate a dropdown for users to compare responses generated by OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini, and DeepSeek.

### 🛠️ Tools and Platforms:
1. **Google Colab**: Used for data exploration, training, and evaluation of the digit recognition model.  
2. **Python**: Primary programming language for machine learning, data preprocessing, and API development.  
3. **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and building classical ML models.  
4. **TensorFlow**: For building and training deep learning models (if needed for improved performance).  
5. **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations during the analysis phase.  
6. **FastAPI**: For exposing the trained model as an API and building backend services.
